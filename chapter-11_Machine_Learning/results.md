## ✔️ Implementations Completed

### Data Splitting
- Created `split_data()` for randomized splitting.
- Built `train_test_split()` ensuring feature-target pairing.

Result:
✔️ Correct proportions verified using assertions.

---

### Model Evaluation Metrics

Successfully implemented:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

Assertions confirm correctness.

## 🧪 Observations

### ✔️ Accuracy Can Be Misleading
A model predicting "NOT fraud" always may still reach high accuracy if fraud is rare.

Lesson:
👉 Always check precision and recall.

---

### ✔️ Importance of Proper Test Data

Bad split → Model memorizes patterns.  
Good split → Model generalizes.

Major takeaway:
> Test data must represent **unseen reality**.
