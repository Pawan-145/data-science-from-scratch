# Chapter 2 – Python Basics

## What I Practiced

- Python indentation and nested loops.
- Importing modules and aliasing.
- Writing functions and lambda expressions.
- String formatting using f-strings.
- Exception handling with try/except.
- Lists, tuples and variable swapping.
- Dictionary operations and safe access using get().
- Counting patterns using manual methods and defaultdict.
- Frequency counting using Counter.
- Sets and membership performance.
- Control flow and ternary expressions.
- Truthiness behavior in Python.
- Sorting using custom keys.
- List comprehensions.
- Automated testing using assert.
- Object Oriented Programming and inheritance.
- Generators and iterators.
- Random number generation and sampling.
- Regular expressions.
- Zip, unpacking, *args and **kwargs.
- Decorators and function wrapping.
- Type annotations and typing module.

## Key Learnings

- Python provides many built-in tools to write clean and expressive code.
- defaultdict and Counter simplify counting problems significantly.
- Generators allow memory-efficient iteration.
- Type hints improve readability and correctness.
- Writing small test assertions increases confidence in code.
