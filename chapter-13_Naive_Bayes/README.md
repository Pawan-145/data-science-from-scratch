# Chapter 13 — Naive Bayes Spam Classifier

## Overview

This project implements a **Naive Bayes classifier from scratch** to detect spam emails.

The chapter focuses on understanding probabilistic machine learning and applying Bayes’ theorem to real-world text data.

## Objectives

- Understand Bayes’ Theorem
- Learn the Naive independence assumption
- Implement tokenization
- Build a spam classifier
- Train on real email data
- Analyze spam probabilities

## Key Learning Outcomes

This chapter helped me:

- Understand probabilistic classifiers  
- Build ML algorithms from scratch  
- Work with real-world datasets  
- Strengthen my machine learning fundamentals

## Why This Project Matters

Naive Bayes is still widely used in production systems because it is:

✅ Fast  
✅ Efficient  
✅ Reliable  
✅ Easy to scale  

It serves as an excellent foundation before moving to more complex models.
