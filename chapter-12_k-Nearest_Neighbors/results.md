# 📊 Chapter 12 – Results

## ✔ Implemented Majority Voting
Built a voting mechanism to determine class predictions based on neighbor labels.

**Outcome:**  
Gained practical understanding of how classification decisions are made.

---

## ✔ Developed Distance Functions
Implemented Euclidean distance to measure similarity between vectors.

**Key Insight:**  
Distance is the foundation of KNN predictions.

---

## ✔ Built a KNN Classifier from Scratch
Created a fully working classifier without relying on external ML libraries.

Pipeline:

Data → Distance Calculation → Neighbor Selection → Voting → Prediction

**Outcome:**  
Strengthened core machine learning intuition.

---

## ✔ Worked with a Real Dataset (Iris)
Loaded and structured real-world classification data.

Practiced:

- Data parsing  
- Feature extraction  
- Label handling  

**Outcome:**  
Improved confidence in handling practical datasets.

---

## ✔ Performed Train-Test Splitting
Separated data into training and testing subsets.

**Lesson Learned:**

> True model performance is measured on unseen data.

---

## ✔ Explored the Curse of Dimensionality
Experimented with higher-dimensional datasets.

### Observation:
- Distances between points became increasingly similar.
- Neighbor-based learning became less effective.

**Conclusion:**  
High dimensionality can significantly degrade model performance.
