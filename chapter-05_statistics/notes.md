# Chapter 5 — Statistics Notes

## ✅ Central Tendency
- Mean: average of data
- Median: middle value after sorting
- Quantile: value below which p% of data lies
- Mode: most frequent value(s)

## ✅ Dispersion
- Range = max - min
- Variance = average squared deviation from mean
- Standard deviation = sqrt(variance)
- Interquartile range = Q3 - Q1

## ✅ Relationships
- Covariance: how two variables move together
- Correlation: normalized covariance between -1 and 1

## ✅ Outliers
- Outliers can strongly affect correlation
- Removing outliers can reveal real trends

## ⚠ Confounding Variables
- External factors affecting both cause and result

## ⚠ Simpson’s Paradox
- Trends in groups can reverse when data is combined
