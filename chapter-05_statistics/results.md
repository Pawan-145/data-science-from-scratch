# Chapter 5 — Results & Observations

## ✔ Implemented from scratch:
- Mean, median, quantiles, mode
- Variance and standard deviation
- Covariance and correlation

## ✔ Observations
- Mean is sensitive to outliers.
- Median is more stable for skewed data.
- Correlation only measures linear relationship.
- Removing outliers changed correlation significantly.

## ✔ Learning Outcome
I now understand how statistical formulas work internally,
not just by using NumPy or Pandas functions.
