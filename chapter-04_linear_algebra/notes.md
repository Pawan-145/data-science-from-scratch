# Chapter 4 — Linear Algebra Notes

## ✅ Vectors
- Represented as lists of floats.
- Operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Scalar multiplication
  - Mean of vectors
  - Dot product
  - Sum of squares
  - Magnitude
  - Distance between vectors

## ✅ Important Concepts
- Dot product measures similarity between vectors.
- Magnitude represents vector length.
- Distance is calculated using magnitude of difference vector.

## ✅ Matrices
- Matrix = list of lists.
- Shape = (rows, columns)
- Functions:
  - get_row()
  - get_column()
  - make_matrix()
  - identity_matrix()

## ✅ Why This Matters in Data Science
- Vectors represent data points.
- Distance is used in clustering and KNN.
- Matrices are used in transformations and ML models.
