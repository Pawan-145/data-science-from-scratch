# Chapter 4 — Linear Algebra

This folder contains my implementation of vector and matrix operations
from the book **Data Science from Scratch by Joel Grus**.

## 📂 Files

- `linear_algebra.py` → All vector and matrix functions
- `notes.md` → Theory and concepts learned
- `results.md` → Observations and learning outcomes

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### Vectors
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Scalar multiplication
- Mean
- Dot product
- Magnitude
- Distance

### Matrices
- Shape
- Row and column extraction
- Identity matrix
- Custom matrix generation

## 🎯 Goal

To understand how linear algebra concepts are implemented in Python
before using them in machine learning algorithms.
