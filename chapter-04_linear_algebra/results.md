# Chapter 4 — Results & Observations

## ✔ All vector operations worked correctly:
- Vector addition and subtraction
- Scalar multiplication
- Vector sum and mean
- Dot product
- Magnitude and distance

## ✔ Matrix operations:
- Shape detection works
- Row and column extraction works
- Identity matrix generated correctly

## ✔ Assertions Used
Assertions were added to verify:
- Correct outputs of vector operations
- Identity matrix correctness

## 📌 Learning Outcome
I now understand how math operations are implemented using Python,
not just formulas on paper. This will help in ML algorithms later.
