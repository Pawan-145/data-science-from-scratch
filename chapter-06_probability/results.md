## Conditional Probability Simulation

Estimated values:
- P(both | older) ≈ 0.50
- P(both | either) ≈ 0.33

Matches theoretical probability.

## Normal Distribution Plots

Observed:
- Larger σ → wider curve
- Smaller σ → sharper peak
- Shifting μ moves the center

## Binomial vs Normal Approximation

Histogram of binomial trials closely matches
normal distribution curve when n is large.

This confirms the Central Limit Theorem.
