# Probability – Notes

## Conditional Probability

Instead of using formulas, probability can be estimated using simulations.
This is useful when direct calculation is difficult.

Example:
P(both girls | older child is girl)

## Continuous Random Variables

Uniform distribution between [0,1]:
- PDF = 1 inside range
- CDF increases linearly

## Normal Distribution

Important properties:
- Bell shaped curve
- Defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ)

Used in:
- Noise modeling
- Measurement errors
- ML assumptions

## Central Limit Theorem

As sample size increases:
Binomial distribution → Normal distribution

This explains why normal distribution appears everywhere in nature.
