# Hypothesis Testing – Notes

## Null and Alternative Hypothesis

Null hypothesis (H0): assumed true until evidence suggests otherwise.

## Type I Error

Rejecting H0 when it is actually true.

## Type II Error

Failing to reject H0 when it is false.

## Power of Test

Probability of correctly rejecting false null hypothesis.

Power = 1 - P(Type II error)

## p-value

Probability of observing data at least as extreme as actual result
if null hypothesis is true.

Small p-value → reject null hypothesis.

## Confidence Interval

Range of values that likely contains true parameter.

## Bayesian Inference

Posterior ∝ Likelihood × Prior

Beliefs are updated using observed data.
