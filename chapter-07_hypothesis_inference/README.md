# Chapter 7 – Hypothesis and Inference

This chapter implements statistical hypothesis testing and inference
using normal approximations and simulations.

## Topics Covered

- Normal approximation to binomial
- Probability bounds and confidence intervals
- Type I and Type II errors
- Statistical power of tests
- p-values (two-sided and one-sided)
- Monte Carlo validation
- A/B testing
- Bayesian inference basics (Beta distribution)

## Practical Applications

- Product A/B testing
- Scientific experiments
- ML model evaluation
- Robotics sensor uncertainty

All methods are implemented from scratch using Python and math.
