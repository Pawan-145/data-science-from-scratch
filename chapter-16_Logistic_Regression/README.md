# Chapter 16 — Logistic Regression & Support Vector Machines

This chapter focuses on **binary classification**, introducing Logistic Regression and the geometric intuition behind Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Unlike regression models that predict continuous values, classification models predict probabilities and class labels.
