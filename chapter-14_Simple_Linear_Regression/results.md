# Chapter 14 – Results

## Objective

Implement Simple Linear Regression to model the relationship between:

- Number of friends (X)
- Daily minutes spent (Y)

---

## What Was Implemented

✔ Calculated alpha and beta analytically  
✔ Computed prediction errors  
✔ Measured model performance using R²  
✔ Implemented Gradient Descent  
✔ Compared analytical vs iterative approach  

---

## Key Outcomes

### ✔ Best-fit Regression Line Found
The model successfully identified a linear trend between the variables.

---

### ✔ Gradient Descent Converged
Loss consistently decreased during iterations, proving that the optimization worked correctly.

Example progress:

loss → decreasing → stable

---

### ✔ Analytical and Gradient Results Matched
Both methods produced nearly identical alpha and beta values.

This validates:

✅ Correct gradient calculations  
✅ Proper learning rate  
✅ Accurate implementation  

---

## Model Performance

- Squared errors minimized  
- Predictions closely followed actual data  
- Regression explained a strong portion of variance  

(R² indicated a good fit.)

---

## What This Proves

✔ Linear regression works well for correlated data  
✔ Gradient descent is reliable for parameter tuning  
✔ Mathematical and computational approaches align  

---

## Skills Practiced
